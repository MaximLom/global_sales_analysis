# Global Sales Analysis: Data-Driven Insights for Business Improvement

This project is a comprehensive analysis of global sales data for a company operating in the retail and e-commerce sectors. The main goal is to explore key performance indicators, uncover valuable insights, and provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing business strategy.

## Project Stages

The project encompasses a complete data analysis lifecycle, including:
* **Data Overview:** Gaining an initial understanding of the data structure.
* **Data Cleaning:** Preparing and cleaning the data, handling missing values and anomalies.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performing an in-depth analysis to discover patterns, correlations, and key trends.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating visualizations (charts and graphs) to present analysis results clearly and effectively.

## Data Sources and Tools

**Data Sources:**
The dataset consists of three `.csv` files containing information about sales, products, and countries:
* `events.csv`: Detailed sales records over several years.
* `products.csv`: Information about product categories and their unique codes.
* `countries.csv`: A list of countries, regions, and their codes.

**Tools and Libraries:**
The project was developed in Google Colab. The following Python libraries were used for data analysis and visualization:
* `pandas` - for data manipulation.
* `numpy` - for numerical operations.
* `matplotlib` and `seaborn` - for creating visualizations.

## Key Findings and Recommendations

The data analysis revealed the following key insights:

1.  **Revenue by Product Category:**
    * The **"Cosmetics"** category is the revenue leader, highlighting its significant potential.
    * Data issue: a substantial amount of revenue from the **"Unknown"** category requires further investigation for accurate analysis.
    * The **"Vegetables"** category shows occasional revenue spikes, possibly due to seasonal or large transactions.

2.  **Geographical Analysis:**
    * **Europe** generates significantly more revenue than **Asia**, indicating a need to develop a strategy for the Asian market.
    * **Significant differences in delivery times** were found between countries, pointing to logistical challenges that require optimization.

3.  **Sales Channels and Logistics:**
    * Revenue from **online** and **offline** channels is nearly equal, suggesting the effectiveness of an omnichannel strategy.
    * **Negative correlation between delivery time and profit:** The longer the delivery time, the greater the losses or lower the profit. This highlights the importance of logistics optimization for maximizing profitability.

4.  **Time-based Analysis:**
    * Sales are **evenly distributed** throughout the week, which indicates a stable demand.
